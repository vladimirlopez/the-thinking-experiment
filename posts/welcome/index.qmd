I’m a physics teacher with broad interests and a deep curiosity for how we learn, how we teach, and how we make sense of the world.

Over the years, I’ve taught high school Math, Science, and Engineering. Lately, I’ve been exploring how AI can support teaching, learning, and even thinking itself. I’m trying a lot of things — in the classroom, in code, in my own workflows — and this blog is a space to share what I discover.

But this isn’t just about physics or AI.

It’s about the bigger picture: how we grow as educators, how curiosity evolves over time, and how ideas from science, literature, philosophy, and everyday experience shape the way we see and explain the world.

**The Thinking Experiment** is part lab notebook, part essay collection, part journal of the unexpected. I hope you’ll find something here that makes you think — or re-think — along the way.

Let the experiment begin.

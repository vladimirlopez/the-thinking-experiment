## Introduction

Have you ever wanted to use AI coding assistance without sending your code to external servers? Continue with Ollama provides the perfect solution - a powerful AI coding assistant that runs entirely on your local machine. In this post, I'll walk you through setting up this privacy-focused development environment.

## What is Continue?

Continue is an open-source AI coding assistant that integrates seamlessly with VS Code. Unlike cloud-based solutions, Continue can work with local language models, giving you:

- **Complete privacy** - Your code never leaves your machine
- **No internet dependency** - Work offline without interruption
- **Cost control** - No API fees or usage limits
- **Customization** - Fine-tune models for your specific needs

## What is Ollama?

Ollama is a lightweight, extensible framework for building and running language models locally. It makes it incredibly easy to:

- Download and run popular models like Mistral, Llama, and CodeLlama
- Switch between different models instantly
- Manage model versions and configurations
- Serve models via a simple API

## Setting Up Your Local AI Development Environment

### Step 1: Install Ollama

First, download and install Ollama from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai). Once installed, you can pull the models you need:

```bash
# Install coding-focused models
ollama pull mistral:7b
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:1.5b-base
ollama pull nomic-embed-text:latest
```

### Step 2: Install Continue Extension

In VS Code:
1. Open the Extensions panel (Ctrl+Shift+X)
2. Search for "Continue"
3. Install the Continue extension

### Step 3: Configure Continue

Create or edit your Continue configuration file (`.continue/config.yaml`):

```yaml
name: "Local AI Assistant"
version: 1.0.0
schema: v1

models:
  - name: "Mistral 7B (Chat)"
    provider: ollama
    model: mistral:7b
    roles:
      - chat
      - edit
      - apply

  - name: "Qwen Coder (Autocomplete)"
    provider: ollama
    model: qwen2.5-coder:1.5b-base
    roles:
      - autocomplete

  - name: "Nomic Embed (Search)"
    provider: ollama
    model: nomic-embed-text:latest
    roles:
      - embed

context:
  - provider: code
  - provider: docs
  - provider: diff
  - provider: terminal
  - provider: problems
  - provider: folder
    depth: 3
  - provider: codebase
```

## Using Your Local AI Assistant

### Chat Interface
Open the Continue sidebar and start chatting with your AI assistant. You can ask questions like:
- "Explain this code"
- "How can I optimize this function?"
- "Write unit tests for this class"

### Code Completion
As you type, Continue will provide intelligent autocomplete suggestions powered by your local Qwen model.

### Code Editing
Highlight code and ask Continue to:
- Refactor functions
- Add error handling
- Optimize performance
- Generate documentation

## Benefits of This Setup

### Privacy First
Your sensitive code and proprietary algorithms never leave your development machine. This is crucial for:
- Enterprise development
- Personal projects with sensitive data
- Compliance with strict data policies

### Performance
Local models provide:
- Near-instant responses
- No network latency
- Consistent availability

### Cost Effective
After the initial setup, there are no ongoing costs:
- No API fees
- No usage limits
- No subscription required

## Tips for Success

### Model Selection
- **Mistral 7B**: Great balance of capability and speed for general coding tasks
- **Qwen2.5-Coder**: Optimized for code completion and programming tasks
- **Nomic Embed**: Excellent for semantic search across your codebase

### Hardware Considerations
- **RAM**: 16GB+ recommended for running multiple models
- **GPU**: Optional but significantly improves performance
- **Storage**: Models typically range from 1-8GB each

### Customization
Continue allows extensive customization:
- Custom system prompts
- Project-specific configurations
- Custom commands and shortcuts

## Conclusion

Setting up Continue with Ollama creates a powerful, private, and cost-effective AI development environment. You get the benefits of modern AI coding assistance while maintaining complete control over your code and data.

The combination of Continue's intuitive interface and Ollama's efficient model serving creates a seamless development experience that rivals any cloud-based solution.

## Next Steps

Now that you have your local AI assistant set up, try:
1. Experimenting with different models for various tasks
2. Creating custom commands for your workflow
3. Exploring Continue's advanced features like codebase search
4. Fine-tuning models for your specific domain

Happy coding with your new AI-powered development environment!

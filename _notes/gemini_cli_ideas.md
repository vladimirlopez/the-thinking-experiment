<!-- This file contains my ideas for the Gemini CLI post -->
## Hook
In the movies there is always a hacker or a guy that knows a lot about computers in front of a terminal typing commands like crazy and making things happen. Do you want to feel like Mr. Robot? Then use Gemini CLI
## What is Gemini CLI?
CLI means ... so Gemini CLI is just the LLm Gemini running in the terminal. It doesn't mean that it looks bad though. It has several themes to change colors'
## Why the terminal?
To keep everything simple. Typing is fast. Also, form the terminal you can have access to a lot of the terminal commands. This makes gemini very powerful!
## How to install?
Show briefly how to install it in mac, linux, and windows

## My experience
I use gemini cli a lot. It has becoming my to go AI for fast stuff. It has a huge context window (1M tokens), generous limits, good model (gemini 2.5 pro and gemini 2.5 flash), multimodal.
## Uses
### Fixing or changing things in my computer
** Be careful when you allow any AI to apply commands to your computer. It is important that you always approve (and understand) the changes!** 
Sometimes I have to move a lot fo files, add a path for an application, reorganize files, change setups, get my iv4 ports, you get the idea. I am not that proficient that I remember all the correct commands. I can get by with ls, dir, and similar. And don't let me start with where the heck are those setup files to be? I instead use gemini cli, ask in  plain language what I need, and let it do its thing. You can even ask it to generate scripts for you. 
``` You can also run commands directly in gemini cli by using "!" before the command. This changes to a "terminal mode"```
### Organize my Obsidian Vault
I am not following any organization principle for my OBsidian vault. My bad. And I was also learning how to use it. So my vault grew like G. R. R. Martin's notes for "The winds of winter": completely unchecked, gigantous, with a lot of characters and plots... You get the idea. Here comes gemini! I just asked to analyze the vault, re-organize it, ad tags, etc. You can also ask for organizational method. Creating MOC, you name it!
### Vibe-Coding 
OF course you can use gemini cli as your coding agent! Let's imagine the workflow. 1 st you ask, always in plain language, gemini to get a github repo. Then you ask it to analyze it. Or you give it instructions to create a new project. From then, just keep the conversation, approve changes, and check the results. Remember to comit and push often, just ask gemini to do it. 
### Keep a blog
My blog setup is vscode + quarto + github. (See previous post) But i am gravitating more and more towards gemini. It has solved some issues with my quarto themes, for example. And whenever I want to publish anything, i just ask. I don't need to type the quarto commands. I know that it is better to learn them and remembering them, but I am actually using gemini for learning those commands too! I ask what i need in plain language and I see what gemini write for the command. It is helping me to learn. (Note for AI: This last information might be an intersting point to make in its own)
## What else is left there?
I have not talk yet about the gemini tools and the MCP. I am not proficient on this yet, so I am still learning. I haven't tested them yet. I will post something new when I have more info
## My main Idea: Gemini CLI as a an already programmed Agent
A lot is written about agentic AI. I kind of use gemini cli as my agent, no need to code it. I know it is not exactly an "agent" but it feels like it to me.

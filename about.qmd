I'm **Vladimir G. L√≥pez**, originally from Asturias, Spain, and now based in Houston, Texas. I'm a bilingual STEM educator with a Master's degree in Physics and extensive experience teaching high school Math, Science, and Engineering.

My career began in the Houston Independent School District, where I taught at Madison High School and East Early College High School. I was honored as the **KBR Science Teacher of the Year (2014)** and **[HISD Secondary Teacher of the Year (2015)](https://www.chron.com/neighborhood/bellaire/news/article/HISD-Secondary-Teacher-of-Year-Lopez-says-9708710.php)**. I've also served as an Adjunct Physics Professor at Houston Community College.

Today, I teach at **The Kinkaid School**, where I'm also the robotics coach. During the summer, I direct the **EMSI (Engineering, Math & Science Institute)** program.

I'm a firm believer in **learning by doing**, so I design hands-on physics lessons, lead robotics teams, and develop online curricula infused with instructional technology and emerging AI tools.

- My go-to tunes? Jazz, blues, and classic rock.
- I play chess (yes, I *do* wear glasses and am a total nerd‚Äîit's practically clich√©!).

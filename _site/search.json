    "text": "I‚Äôm a physics teacher with broad interests and a deep curiosity for how we learn, how we teach, and how we make sense of the world.\nOver the years, I‚Äôve taught high school Math, Science, and Engineering. Lately, I‚Äôve been exploring how AI can support teaching, learning, and even thinking itself. I‚Äôm trying a lot of things ‚Äî in the classroom, in code, in my own workflows ‚Äî and this blog is a space to share what I discover.\nBut this isn‚Äôt just about physics or AI.\nIt‚Äôs about the bigger picture: how we grow as educators, how curiosity evolves over time, and how ideas from science, literature, philosophy, and everyday experience shape the way we see and explain the world.\nThe Thinking Experiment is part lab notebook, part essay collection, part journal of the unexpected. I hope you‚Äôll find something here that makes you think ‚Äî or re-think ‚Äî along the way.\nLet the experiment begin."

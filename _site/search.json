    "text": "Vladimir G. L√≥pez at CERN\n\n\nI‚Äôm Vladimir G. L√≥pez, originally from Asturias, Spain, and now based in Houston, Texas. I‚Äôm a bilingual STEM educator with a Master‚Äôs degree in Physics and extensive experience teaching high school Math, Science, and Engineering.\nMy career began in the Houston Independent School District, where I taught at Madison High School and East Early College High School. I was honored as the KBR Science Teacher of the Year (2014) and HISD Secondary Teacher of the Year (2015). I‚Äôve also served as an Adjunct Physics Professor at Houston Community College.\nToday, I teach at The Kinkaid School, where I‚Äôm also the robotics coach. During the summer, I direct the EMSI (Engineering, Math & Science Institute) program.\nI‚Äôm a firm believer in learning by doing, so I design hands-on physics lessons, lead robotics teams, and develop online curricula infused with instructional technology and emerging AI tools.\n\n\nüëì A bit about me personally\n\nI love reading‚Äîand I read everything from philosophy to science to fiction.\nMy go-to tunes? Jazz, blues, and classic rock.\nI play chess (yes, I do wear glasses and am a total nerd‚Äîit‚Äôs practically clich√©!).\n\n\n\n\n‚öóÔ∏è What this blog is\nThe Thinking Experiment is where I share: - My experiments using AI in teaching and learning. - Reflections on education, science, literature, and philosophy. - Moments of curiosity, failure, and growth as an educator and human.\nThanks for joining me on this journey!"

    "text": "üìò Welcome to my blog ‚Äî a space where I‚Äôll be exploring ideas about teaching, physics, coding, and AI.\nFittingly, my first post is about the blog itself. Why? Because the act of creating it turned out to be an interesting project in its own right. It started with a simple question:\nHow do I create a blog that lets me write about code and science, and format things like equations and code blocks easily?\nI wanted more than just another Medium clone. I needed a platform where I could:\nSo I asked ChatGPT.\nAfter some back and forth, the best setup for my needs turned out to be:\nI‚Äôm already using GitHub Copilot through my education account, and since I‚Äôm also teaching a course on vibe-coding the whole project felt on-theme. (More on vibe-coding soon.)"

    "text": "üîß How I Set Up This Blog\nHere‚Äôs a quick rundown of the steps I followed to get everything working:\n\nInstall Quarto\nI downloaded and installed Quarto. It‚Äôs an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that integrates beautifully with VS Code.\n\n\nCreate a new Quarto project\nIn the VS Code terminal, I used the Quarto extension to create a new website project:\nquarto create-project myblog --type website\n\n\nCreate structure and posts\nNow comes the beauty of using Copilot Pro Agent: I just asked the agent to create the files, folders, modify the index.qmd, add my pictures, etc. Isntead of looking for the commands in google or asking chatgpt in a different window, I ask Copilot Agent in plain english. ### Preview the site locally I used:\nquarto preview\nThis lets me see changes live in my browser as I edit.\n\n\nPush to GitHub\nI initialized a Git repo, committed everything, and pushed it to a new GitHub repository.\n\n\nEnable GitHub Pages\nIn the GitHub repo settings, I enabled Pages and selected the main branch and /docs folder as the source.\n\n\nPublish with Quarto\nI rendered the site into the docs folder using:\nquarto render\nNow the site is live at: üëâ https://vladimirlopez.github.io/the-thinking-experiment\n\nThat‚Äôs it for now. This blog will be a thinking space ‚Äî a lab notebook, a course companion, and maybe a bit of a philosophical experiment. Thanks for reading the very first post.\nNext up: What is vibe-coding, really?"

    "text": "I‚Äôm a physics teacher with broad interests and a deep curiosity for how we learn, how we teach, and how we make sense of the world.\nOver the years, I‚Äôve taught high school Math, Science, and Engineering. Lately, I‚Äôve been exploring how AI can support teaching, learning, and even thinking itself. I‚Äôm trying a lot of things ‚Äî in the classroom, in code, in my own workflows ‚Äî and this blog is a space to share what I discover.\nBut this isn‚Äôt just about physics or AI.\nIt‚Äôs about the bigger picture: how we grow as educators, how curiosity evolves over time, and how ideas from science, literature, philosophy, and everyday experience shape the way we see and explain the world.\nThe Thinking Experiment is part lab notebook, part essay collection, part journal of the unexpected. I hope you‚Äôll find something here that makes you think ‚Äî or re-think ‚Äî along the way.\nLet the experiment begin."
